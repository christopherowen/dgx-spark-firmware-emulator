# Booting the recovery Linux under the Spark profile

`tools/run_linux.py` boots the vendor recovery kernel under the plain `virt` machine and reaches
userspace. Booting the same kernel *under the firmware profile* — the vendor UEFI on top of this
repository's monitor — is a different question, and this page records how far that gets and what
stops it. Nothing here is a claim that the profile runs Linux; the boundary is stated at the end.

## Why a loader at all

The recovery image boots through grub, which is what supplies the kernel's command line and the
initrd path. Under the profile the firmware's own boot order matches nothing on the emulated NVMe
namespace, so a probe delivered over the network does that job. `tests/fixtures/linux_loader.c` is
that probe: it finds the volume that carries the kernel, loads `VMLINUZ.IMG` and `INITRD`, starts the
kernel with the recovery command line, and returns the status if control ever comes back.

Four things about that call are not what the UEFI specification would lead a reader to expect, each
learned from a run:

- **A parent image handle is required.** `LoadImage` with a NULL parent is refused with
  `EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER`, as is a file-system handle. Passing the loader's own image handle works.
- **The command line is not a `LoadImage` argument.** It is the `LoadOptions` field of the loaded
  image's `EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_PROTOCOL`, set between `LoadImage` and `StartImage`.
- **`initrd=` resolves against the loaded image's device path.** The loader hands `LoadImage` the
  *volume's* device path so that `initrd=\INITRD` finds the volume the files came from, not the
  network volume the probe arrived on.
- **`unsigned long` is 32 bits on this target's ABI.** A request word packed with `<< 40` in a `long`
  truncates silently; the fixtures use an explicit 64-bit type.

## The volume

`tools/make_esp.py` writes the FAT32 image from files given on the command line, without mkfs or
mtools:

```sh
python3 tools/make_esp.py --out firmware/state/esp.img \
    --add VMLINUZ.IMG=firmware/downloads/recovery-extract/vmlinuz.Image \
    --add INITRD=firmware/downloads/recovery-extract/initrd
python3 tools/boot_spark.py --pxe-test --board --flash-image firmware/state/board-2158.bin \
    --firmware-version 2.158.15 --pxe-image loader.efi --pxe-marker LOADER-STARTING \
    --nvme-image firmware/state/esp.img --memory 3G
```

The volume carries what a FAT32 file system requires and what a UEFI driver checks: at least 65525
clusters, reserved-sector FAT entries, a backup boot sector, an FSInfo sector.

The cluster floor is the one that bites. The first image this tool wrote used 4 KiB clusters in
238 MB, which is 58 500 clusters — fewer than FAT32 requires. mtools read it, `mkfs.vfat` would have
written it, and the firmware presented **no volume at all**: the loader's `LocateHandle` came back
`EFI_NOT_FOUND`, which reads like a broken loader rather than a malformed volume. With 512-byte
clusters (162 MB total for the same two files) the same loader finds eight file systems, reads the
kernel and its initrd and starts it (`firmware/runs/20261108T211101`, `LOADER-STARTING`).

`tests/test_make_esp.py` reads the image back with an independent parser, checks the cluster count
against the boot sector's own numbers, and opens the image under mtools when mtools is installed.

## What the profile does today

The kernel boots. Recorded run (`firmware/runs/20261109T035647.028894Z`, 3 GiB guest):

```

Getting there took four measured steps, each of which had to be fixed where it lived:

- **The secure monitor must enable the registers a current kernel writes.** The kernel programs
  `PIR_EL1`/`PIRE0_EL1` (permission indirection), `GCSCR_EL1`/`GCSCRE0_EL1` (guarded control
  stack), `HCRX_EL2`, the fine-grained trap registers, `TCR2_EL1` and `SCTLR2_EL2` during its
  early boot. Each is gated by an `SCR_EL3` enable — `PIEN` (45), `GCSEN` (39), `HXEN` (38),
  `FGTEN` (27), `TCR2EN` (43), `SCTLR2En` (44) — and with a bit clear the access traps to EL3.
  Finding that list was the hard part and it was found by instrumenting QEMU, not by guessing: the
  emulator now logs any system-register access routed to EL3, with the register's name and the
  trap controls, so the next one names itself.
- **The console has to be named.** The firmware's SPCR describes a 16550 with 32-bit registers at
  `0x16a00000` — exactly what the profile models — but a kernel booted through `LoadImage` has no
  device tree to tell it that, so `earlycon=uart8250,mmio32,0x16a00000` goes in the command line.
  Without it the boot is silent and looks dead.
- **The ITS was at the wrong address.** The captured MADT declares it (`record type 0x0f`, ID 0) at
  `0x06840000`, while the inherited `virt` machine mapped QEMU's ITS at `0x08080000`; the kernel
  trusted the table, found nothing at the address it was given, and its first ITS table write was an
  external abort in `its_map_one`. Relocating the model to the declared address fixed it — the boot
  now reports `ITS [mem 0x06840000-0x0685ffff]`, allocates device and collection tables, and reaches
  userspace **without** `irqchip.gicv3_nolpi=1`.
- **`_CPC` is read at boot, so the block that holds it has to exist.** `\_SB.MTEL` declares
  `Memory32Fixed(0x05170000, 0x00060000)`, and ACPICA's system-memory handler faults on any address
  in it that the machine does not back. The profile now models that block — zero-backed, because
  the values are what the firmware would have programmed and this profile does not claim to know
  them. Before that, the abort landed in `acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler` with `x19 =
  0x51cc404`, the first `_CPC` register.

## Where it stops

The boot reaches `[3.01] scmi_core: SCMI protocol bus registered` and then produces nothing for
twelve minutes of wall time, on two runs and with `keep_bootcon`. The vCPU thread in QEMU
accumulates CPU time throughout, so the guest is executing, not waiting — a loop in code rather than
an MMIO wait (an MMIO exit would release the BQL and a second QMP connection would answer; it does
not).

The `scmi_core` message is `scmi_bus_init()`, a bus registration, not the transport handshake, so
the stall is in some *later* subsystem initialiser and the last line is only where printing stopped.
Finding it needs the guest's PC, which is why the trace plugin grew a sampler
(`--trace-sample N`: the address of every N-th translated basic block, through a per-block execution
callback so an already-translated hot loop still samples).

## It reaches userspace

Recorded run (`firmware/runs/20261109T055050.743794Z`, 3 GiB guest):

```
[   25.430779] Freeing initrd memory: 80912K
[   28.070124] Run /init as init process
--- FastOS Version
VERSION="1.155.49"
```

That is the vendor's recovery installer running as init, under the vendor UEFI, under this
repository's monitor. Three more things had to be right:

- **The monitor must not dereference a guest address.** A trapped system-register access was being
  decoded by reading the instruction at `ELR_EL3`; once the guest had its MMU on, that is a guest
  virtual address that EL3 cannot translate, and the monitor itself took the abort
  (`FAR=0xffff80008001922c`, EL3 faulting). The register is now named from the syndrome
  (`ESR_EL3`'s ISS carries Op0/Op1/CRn/CRm/Op2 and Rt), so nothing is read from guest memory.
- **An SMMU the profile does not model must read as absent, not abort.** The kernel's
  `arm_smmu_device_hw_probe` aborted on the first identification register. Reads of unmodelled SoC
  windows now return zero — `arm-smmu-v3` then reports `probe ... returned 6` (-ENXIO) and the boot
  continues.
- **Unmodelled SoC MMIO is inert by default.** `0x10000000-0x1F000000` and `0x30000000-0x32000000`
  are mapped as a read-zero/write-drop window *under* the modelled devices, so a driver that probes
  an address the firmware names finds "no device" instead of taking the machine down.

## Every block the firmware declares has to exist

A kernel reads ACPI-declared memory through ACPICA's system-memory handler, and an address the
machine does not back is an external abort that kills the boot. The profile therefore backs every
block the vendor DSDT names, in one reusable RAM-backed device:

| block | who reads it | note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x05170000` +0x60000 | `_CPC` registers, the power/performance interface | zero-backed |
| `0x1C238000` +0x1000 | `\_TZ.RREG(0x1C238818…0x1C238834)`, the thermal zones | seeded with tenths of a kelvin (45, 40, 50, 35, 55, 30, 60 °C) so a zone reports a plausible temperature |
| `0x1C870200` +0x400, `0x311C0000` +0x100 | declared by `\_SB.MTEL` | zero-backed |

`tests/test_declared_blocks.py` checks all of them, plus the console window, in two seconds.

The console needed the same treatment for a different reason: it is a **MediaTek 8250**, and
`mtk8250_set_termios` writes vendor registers past the eight a 16550 models — outside the model that
is an external abort in `mem32_serial_out`. The 16550 now sits inside a 4 KiB container with scratch
registers behind it, so a vendor register reads back present and inert.

## A closed lever: answering the runtime service as if it were the flash service

`efisubsys_init` stalls in a loop of FF-A direct requests. Traced from the monitor
(`firmware/runs/20261109T075617`, `--flash-trace`), the repeated call is
`FFA_MSG_SEND_DIRECT_REQ` — SMC function `0xC400006F` — with destination endpoint `3`, source endpoint
`0`, and message words `0xC4000064` and a buffer address (`a1=0x3`, `a3=0xc4000064`, `a4=0x93a7f000`),
**641 times** before the run ends. Two corrections to an earlier reading of that line: `0xC4000064` is a
**message word**, not the SMC function id, and endpoint `3` is not the eSPI/flash partition number
(`0x8003`/`0x8002`) — they are different numbering schemes. The trace's `ns` field reads `0`, so this call
is not demonstrated to be reachable from non-secure firmware, and it cannot be used as a known-good corpus
for a non-secure probe. It is also not the flash service renumbered — this monitor serves the
flash service at `0x8002` — and it is not an unknown endpoint either: it is the runtime half of the
same MM-communication path the repository already documents for the pre-runtime case. Accepting the `0x8004`
pair and answering it from the same `nor_request()` model looks like the obvious one-line fix, and it
is wrong: the firmware takes a synchronous exception immediately (`Synchronous Exception at
0x0000000084…`). Endpoint `0x8004` is a different service with a different protocol, not the flash
service under another number, and replying to it with flash semantics breaks the caller. The profile
therefore keeps `efi=noruntime` and the limitation is stated rather than papered over.

## What is still missing

The guest reaches the installer's **userspace** — `Run /init as init process`, then the installer's own
banner (`--- FastOS Version`, `VERSION="1.155.49"`), which `tests/test_profile_userspace.py` asserts. It
takes minutes of wall time under TCG, and a boot timeout of up to an hour is allowed for exactly that.
What is still missing is not the handover but the devices: the installation media and target disk are
not attached.

## A closed lever: entering the firmware at EL1

The firmware runs at EL2 and hands its payloads off at EL2, so the kernel inherits EL2. The obvious
shortcut was to enter the firmware at EL1 instead, the way a board without an EL2 stage would. It
does not work: with `SPSR_EL3 = 0x3c5` the firmware prints `MON: enter Spark UEFI` and stops — no
error, no further output, no setup. Entering at EL2 is what this firmware requires.

## Memory

A 3 GiB guest is the useful size (the profile aliases PCI space over the first gigabyte, so the guest
sees two). The harness refuses to start one without roughly 1.25× that in `MemAvailable`; on a host
under memory pressure the run is skipped rather than run into swap.
